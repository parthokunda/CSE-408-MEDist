Thiamine is not stored to any appreciable extent in the body and amounts in excess of the bodyΓÇÖs requirements are excreted in the urine as unchanged thiamine or as metabolites. Pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are readily absorbed from the GIT following oral administration and are converted to the active forms of pyridoxal phosphate an pyridoxamine phosphate.
